## Usage
#### A simple app for recognize the pitch of music. There are two modes, real-time(unfinished) and off-line(finished).

*In real-time mode, you need a microphone plugging in your computer, and the APP will show the real-time pitch that your microphone collecting.
*In off-line mode, you need two musice files. One is teacher(standard) sample, the other is the student sample. Then you can compare pitches of two  samples.

We used QT Creator 3.3.0 to build the whole project, we believe you can just run the project by Click 'Run' in QT.
